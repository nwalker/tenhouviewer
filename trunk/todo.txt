TODO:
4. Find query: waiting on tile;
5. Find query: out count in tempai;
6. Luck calculating;
7. GUI
10. tiles search [by list: 1m, 2m, 3m, 1p, 2p, 3p, 1p, 1p, 2s, 3s, n, n]
12. safe tiles (don't forget kokushi waits)
  - analyze jihai [one full discarded type of tiles - no kokushi, isolated jihai tiles are safe);
  - (without possible kokushi) if player have all tiles [one of jihai], and all other was discarded - they are safe;
  - analyze kabe condition;
  - last dropped tile are safe;
  - tile discarded by all another players are safe (single tile);
  - analyze discarded after riichi tiles [all discarded tiles are safe against riiched player]
  - extended: analyze level of dangerous [http://osamuko.com/basic-defense-techniques-in-mahjong/]
13. waiting type: ryanmen, sanmenchan, kanchan, penchan, tanki, syanpon, etc
14. sliding forms
15. tournier mode? v
  - list of interesting events (yaku, cost, ...);
  - adjustable uma?
16. parsed logs from different files (for example, log.txt, tournier.txt) in different folders: parsed/log/..., parsed/tournier/... [specified by option folder=]?
Search should be repetiable with using generated files (without parsing logs many times) 
18. output discard as image? (+hand, +waiting, m.b. for questions and quizzes): "all", "riichi", "n%", "n";
19. Agari on aka / defined by user tile;

in process:
20. Suji waiting [waiting is suji of discard], suji-waiting to discarded on riichi tile;
	Check: 2013011902gm-0009-0000-085f75c9_19.png [has suji?]
21. Dora count search (ura/aka/dora/all);

completed:
1. Report yaku, han/fu information in paifu;
2. Mark dangerous tiles in paifu (calc waitings [x], furiten [x], option);
3. Write shanten number in paifu (option);
8. Mark tempai [shanten number too]
9. forms search [2334, 34455 etc]
11. options for paifu generation [shanten, yaku, nicknames (or A, B, C, D)]
17. detect and search by suit of color hands (unify discard examples for color hands to one suit), search forced-to-suit hands (>80% tiles in hand in one suit);
15. tournier mode?
  - build games table;
  - calc tournier results table - calc games, calc results (with/without uma), sorting by place;
22. count of dead outs (placed to dead wall, i know at least 5)
